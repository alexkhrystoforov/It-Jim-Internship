Please make a python script which will do the following steps for each frame of the video from the home task 1 and save the result as a new video file.
- put text description e.g. type of a figure (circle, triangle or rectangle) near (or over) each found figure
- visualize contours of found figures by a type specific color (R,G,B, for example)
- make sure your script does correct handling of figures cropped by a frame. (if there is class uncertainty then ignore)

You definitely will need: 
findContours
