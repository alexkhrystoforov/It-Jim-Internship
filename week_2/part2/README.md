Please make a python script that will find symbols on the plan. Better if you manage to find separately symbols with different inner parts.
Save your result as a new image where each found symbol will be highlighted by a bounding rect with a text label in a corner.
Ideally a font or bounding rect color should be a color code of a symbol type.
Bonus task: if you want to get familiar with JSON, please save location and type information of each found symbol in a *.json file. 

You probably will need: 
findContours
